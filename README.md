Do you publish spoilers? Do you wish you could have them on your page in a way that wasn't fucking rude? With Spoiler Alert! you can! Hide spoilers with a bit of blur.

## Usage

To make your site spoiler free, simply include spoiler.js, then, add this somewhere:

```javascript
spoilerAlert('spoiler, .spoiler', {max: 10, partial: 4});
```
